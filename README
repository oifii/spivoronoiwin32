README for the VIDEO_SPI applications
=====================================

VIDEO_SPI is a set of open source video applications targeted for the 
Windows Operating System. This application is part of the VIDEO_SPI
software collection.

VIDEO_SPI's applications are based on popular open source libraries
and should therefore be fairly easy to port to various platforms.

VIDEO_SPI project was started in Montreal in 2010 by Stephane Poirier
with the objective of experimenting with video to understand the process of
creating visual with software applications.

Some VIDEO_SPI applications are used by Carl Poirier who is a Montreal
music composer prototyping an audio operating system called XAOS. The
packaging of the VIDEO_SPI applications sometimes reflects the XAOS
requirements.
